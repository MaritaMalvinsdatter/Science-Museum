                <h2>Cosmology</h2>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic 
                    exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky 
                    and what we can see and know about the universe 
                    around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and 
                    galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early 
                    navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early
                    Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
                    exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled 
                    with the question of our origins. Where do we come from 
                    and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his 
                    theory of evolution we have had a framework for 
                    exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the 
                    species we know today have evolved our time. You can 
                    also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who 
                    didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the 
                    Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major 
                    breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights 
                    into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
                    </p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and 
                    their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth 
                    of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of 
                    exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a 
                    look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery 
                    of penicillin and the first heart transplant. </p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not 
                    only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the 
                    wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and 
                    artificial intelligence are the science of the future. 
                    From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of 
                    robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and 
                    shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

                <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are 
                    having on the planet, the more important it becomes that 
                    scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not 
                    just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the 
                    dangers we currently face including global warming, 
                    extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on 
                    the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter 
                    future.</p>

                <h2>Energetica *</h2>
                <p>From the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica 
                    exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a 
                    series of installations that allow visitors to experience the 
                    power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy 
                    powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines 
                    are able to use and control wind to create power.
