                <h2>Support</h2>
                <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. 
                    Donations are very welcome and are an important way 
                    we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole 
                    community. </p>
                <p>You can also support us by donating items of interest to 
                    the museum’s collections. If you have some item or 
                    collection that you think others would enjoy, please let 
                    us know by contacting our Collections Department and

                <h2>Volunteer</h2>
                <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to 
                    keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to 
                    come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including 
                    getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
                    access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where 
                    all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas 
                    for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
                <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
                    Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about 
                    how you can get involved.</p>
